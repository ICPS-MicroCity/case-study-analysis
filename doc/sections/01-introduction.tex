This document has the purpose of mapping the \textit{Micro City}'s concepts into the amusement park's case study.
This allows to reach a common starting point for different future works.
Specifically, amusement parks will be analyzed defining a ubiquitous language of their domain.
This language will be useful to give a formal definition of the domain's elements.
Moreover, it will explain logic and semantic relationships among the elements of the domain.
