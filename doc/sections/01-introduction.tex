This document has the purpose of mapping \textit{Micro City}'s concepts into the amusement park's case study. This allows to obtain a common starting point for different future works. Specifically, amusement parks will be analyzed defining an ubiquitous language of their domain. This language will be useful to give formal definitions to the domain's elements. Moreover, it will explain logic and semantic relationships among elements of the domain.
